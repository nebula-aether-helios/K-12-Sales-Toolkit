**(Screen: Repo Hero Banner on GitHub)**

"Hi, I'm Ishmael Muhammad. I spent 5 years in the classroom and 2 years as a top-performing SDR. Most candidates just tell you they understand EdTech sales—I built the tools to prove it."

**(Screen: LA Unified Opportunity Analysis Notebook)**

"I know that 68% of pilots fail because of teacher burnout. That's why I built this **District Intelligence Engine**. It doesn't just pull contact info—it analyzes student proficiency gaps, ESSER funding expiration, and Science of Reading adoption signals to score every district in California."

## 0:25 - 0:40 | The Live Demo
**(Screen: Streamlit District Prioritizer App)**

"This isn't just a static analysis. I deployed it as a live app. Here, I can instantly filter for 'Tier 1' targets—districts with high need, high budget, and low political friction. It even predicts **Customer Lifetime Value** using a Gamma-Gamma model I implemented."

**(Screen: Pipeline Health Dashboard)**

"And I don't just find leads; I close them. This dashboard connects to HubSpot to track weighted pipeline health and flag at-risk deals before they stall."
