The sales rep closes the deal. Celebration all around.\n\nSix months later, the pilot is failing.\n\nTeachers are disengaged. Principals are skeptical. The renewal conversation is painful.\n\n**This is the silent killer of ed-tech and PD sales.** It destroys renewal rates, kills referrals,  \nand makes the next district harder to close.\n\nAs a former K-8 teacher, I've lived this from the inside. This notebook shows:\n1. **Why** pilots fail (data from research + my own experience)\n2. **How to identify** bad-fit pilots BEFORE you close them\n3. **The 3 questions** to ask in discovery that predict pilot success\n4. **Why Literacy Partners' model is structurally designed** to avoid this problem\n"
